'External URL' and 'Shortcut' types allows you to let a page be a shortcut to either an external URL or in the latter case a page in the page tree.
'Not in menu' is also a regular page, but will not be shown in the navigation. <em>This page type is deprecated! Please use the "Hide in menu" option!</em>
'Backend User Section' is an option which requires a backend user to be logged in for the page to be visible.

<b>Special types:</b>
'Spacer' is only meaningfull if your frontend navigation is programmed to use it. In this case it does not represent a page with content but is intended to be a non-clickable placeholder in the navigation.
'SysFolder' is a page type which cannot be shown as a webpage but is rather acting as a storage for records of your choice.
'Recycler' is a garbage can. Pages and records in a recycler are not visible in the frontend.

<b>Notice:</b> Each type usually has a specific icon attached. Also certain types may not be available for a user (so you may experience that some of the options are not available for you!).

Normally you should assign aliases only to a limited number of pages, preferably those you need to link to a lot. In most TYPO3 configurations you would be able to use the syntax '.. &lt;link one_two_three&gt;go to the page&lt;/link&gt; ..' to create a link to the page. This is easier to remember.

Setting an integer value at the start of the field adds it as the default type for the page. 
For example, if an RSS feed is configured in Typoscript as typeNum=100, setting the target to 100 could be used to add an RSS link in the menu.

For open in popup use following syntax:
400x200 - this opens page in a popup of size 400x200
230x450:resizable=0,location=1 - opens page in popup with parameters

Combined:
100 600x350 - opens page in popup with type 100

Basically, setting this option just marks the page so the backend knows this page contains eg. a forum or is the root page of a shopping section on the website. And based on this knowledge the backend is able to display a shortcut list as well as relevant functionality in the 'Web>Modules' module. The frontend display is - largely - not affected.
So in effect, by 'marking' a page to be a 'Shop' module simply means it'll show up in the shortcut list of modules in the backend.
