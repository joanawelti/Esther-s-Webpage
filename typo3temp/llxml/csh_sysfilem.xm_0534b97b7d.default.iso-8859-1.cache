If BASE is absolute you should enter the absolute path on the server, eg. "/home/ftp_upload" or "C:/home/ftp_upload". Further you must make sure the configuration variable $TYPO3_CONF_VARS[BE][lockRootPath] contains the first part of the path you want to mount.

<strong>Notice:</strong> In any case, make sure the webserver user which PHP is running as has <em>at least</em> read-access to the path. If not, the mount will simply not appear without any warnings.
If you have problems - especially with absolute mounts - try to mount something "simple" like a relative path in fileadmin. If that is working well, try the absolute path.

Your PHP-configuration may also impose other restrictions on you if safe_mode or open_basedir is enabled. Then use relative paths.";s:13:"_path.seeAlso";s:63:"sys_filemounts:base,
