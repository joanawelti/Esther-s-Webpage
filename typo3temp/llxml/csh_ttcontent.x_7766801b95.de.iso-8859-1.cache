This is a description of the various types:

<strong>Header</strong>
This type allows you insert a standard content element header and nothing more.
Almost all the other types described below also includes the header with the exact same options. So the Header type just provides a way to insert a header <em>only</em> without anything else.

<strong>Text</strong>
The Text type allows you to insert regular page content.

<strong>Text w/image</strong>
This is the same as the Text type (regular page content) but with the option of attaching images.

<strong>Image</strong>
The same as Text w/image but without the text field - so only images.

<strong>Bullet list</strong>
Lets you create a bullet list. Each line in the text-field will appear as a single line in the bulletlist.

<strong>Table</strong>
Lets you create <em>simple</em> tables. Each line represents a tablerow and vertical bars '|' separates each column.

<strong>Filelinks</strong>
Allows you to present a list of files for download. You can have thumbnails attached to the list including filesize.

<strong>Multimedia</strong>
Lets you insert multimedia elements such as sound, video, java applets and flash animations.

<strong>Form</strong>
Lets you create mail forms. There is a special syntax to use when you wish to create form fields.

<strong>Search</strong>
This inserts a search box and it will also display the search result if a query is performed to the page.

<strong>Login</strong>
Displays a login box for website users. You must create at least one Website user and user group before this makes any sense to use.

<strong>Textbox</strong>
This is mainly for customly defined design which includes typically some text and an image. So in other words the function is not generally defined. However the default subtypes will let you choose various ways to display some text with an image.
Use only if instructed to.

<strong>Menu/Sitemap</strong>
Offers a selection of various link menus and a sitemap you can insert on a page.

<strong>Insert records</strong>
This is a placeholder for other records. In other words, by this element you can attach other content elements from elsewhere and thus insert them this page.

<strong>Insert plugin</strong>
This will allow you to insert a forum, guestbook, list of addresses, shopping basket etc. The various features are available <em>only</em> if they are configured correctly in the template of your website. So before you use it, make sure this is the case.

<strong>Script</strong>
This is reserved for custom purposes where the template developer can allow you to insert specialized page content by this element type along with a code to identify which special content you want.

<strong>HTML</strong>
This is plain HTML content. Everything put here will be displayed directly on the page without any preprocessing.";s:14:"_CType.seeAlso";s:161:"tt_content:colPos,

The field is reused in most other types and so switching between the content element types will bring the value of this field with it.

When you're using this field with the "Text" and "Text w/image" types, the content is used as ordinary body text. Each linebreak normally signifies a new paragraph, you can use the special TYPO3 tag, &lt;LINK&gt;, for making links. You can use many HTML tags but there are limitations as well. This will depend on the implementation.

<b>Bulletlists:</b>
If the type is "Bulletlist" each line in this field is a bulletlist entry.

<b>Tables:</b>
If the type is "Table" each line represents a table row. Within each line you divide the columns by inserting a vertical bar, |. So making a table row with 3 columns could look like "This is column 1 | Column 2 here | Third column!". Use the table wizard for creating tables - that is much easier than "coding" them.

<b>Parameters:</b>
Types like "Script", "Form" and "Multimedia" use this field for parameters you can pass to the element. And the "HTML" type accepts any input as raw HTML which is simply displayed on the website without any preprocessing.

<strong>Rich Text Editor:</strong>
With the types "Text" and "Text w/image" the Rich Text editor is used for editing if your browser supports it and the editor is generally enabled in the system. Be aware that the content is "cleansed" before it goes into the database when you're using the "Text" and "Text w/image" types.

<b>Making a mail form:</b>
When you have selected the content element type "Form" you should enter lines of parameters into this field. This is a brief example:

Your name: | *name=input,40 | [Enter name!]
Your email: | *email=input,40
Your address: | address=textarea,40,10
Your haircolor: |hair=radio|Blue=blue, Red=red

|formtype_mail = submit | Send form
|subject=hidden| Enter a subject here!
|html_enabled=hidden | 1

The first two lines makes input-fields for name and email, both are marked "required" by the * and the name field has a default value of "[Enter name!]".
The third line is a text box and the fourth makes radiobuttons to select haircolor.
Then there are three important lines in the end. The first makes a submit button with the label "Send form", the second line is the subject of the email the receiver gets and the third line makes the form result render in an HTML-table.
It is much easier to use the Form Wizard for creating forms.

<b>Notice:</b> Before any form will ever work, you must enter a recipient email address. The "Recipient-email:" field is used for that (this is in fact the Subheader field used!).";s:17:"_bodytext.seeAlso";s:106:"tt_content:CType,

The options "In text" means that the image block is displayed with text aside it. When you select this option the template will probably force the images into smaller dimensions because they cannot take up the same space when text is supposed to float around them.
When you select "In text" you can choose the options either above or below the divider "No wrap". If you select the "In text" option above, the bodytext will float <em>under</em> the image block when the bodytext reaches the end of the image block. So in other words the body text <em>wraps around</em> the image block. If you select "In text" below the "No wrap" divider, the body text will not float under the image block, but simply continue in its column.
Apart from the visual difference there is a technical aspect as well. Because if you choose to allow the content to wrap the image block you will experience a strange phenomenon when you do not have enough bodytext to make it float around the image: You experience that the subsequent content elements on the page is somehow layered on top of the image block - and this certainly looks like a bug.

Generates a classic tree sitemap. Maybe your TypoScript template is configured to another design of the sitemap, but anyhow you'll get a sitemap out of this. Notice that the sitemap will begin from the current page unless you specify another "Startingpoint" page in the list below.

<strong>Section index (pagecontent w/Index checked)</strong>
This makes a menu to the content elements on this page (or the page specified in the Starting point list). Great way to make an index in the top of the page.
